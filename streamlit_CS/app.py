    """
The goal of this project to see how well we can predict a Pokémon’s primary type using only its
six base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by using a machine learning model.

This app uses interactive tools to explore the dataset and customize the Random Forest model used to predict a Pokémon’s primary type.
Use the sidebar to filter the dataset to specific Pokémon to explore how these filters affect the distribution of the data and the accuracy of the model.

Use the **sidebar** to switch between pages:

- 📊 **EDA Gallery**  
  Explore the Pokémon dataset with interactive visualizations.  
  - View a type heatmap and bar chart to see the distribution of primary and secondary types of Pokemon
  - View a series of boxplots to visualize the differences in distribution of Pokémon stats grouped by type.
  - Create a fully customizable scatterplot to explore the distribution of two select stats for all Pokémon in select type groups.

<br>

- ⚙️ **Machine Learning Model**  
  Build and evaluate a Random Forest model that predicts a Pokémon’s primary type.  
  - Adjust model hyperparameters (number of trees, depth, max features, etc.).
  - View a confusion matrix showing exactly what predictions the model is making.
  - See feature importance in a bar chart to understand which stats matter most.
  - Inspect an example decision tree from the forest to better understand the model.

Head over to the other pages in the sidebar to start exploring.
